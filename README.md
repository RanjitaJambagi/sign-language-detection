# Sign Language Detection System

### 📌 Project Description
This project implements a Sign Language Detection System using Machine Learning techniques to recognize hand gestures from images or video input.  
The system aims to help hearing- and speech-impaired individuals communicate more effectively by translating sign language gestures into meaningful output.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Detect and recognize sign language gestures
- Apply machine learning for gesture classification
- Build an assistive communication system
